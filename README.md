## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (includes `cargo`)

### Installation & Running

There are a few ways to run the application:

1.  **Build and Run Manually:**

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/Feromond/budget_tracker_tui
    cd budget_tracker_tui

    # Build the project (use --release for optimized build)
    cargo build --release

    # Run the executable
    ./target/release/Budget_Tracker
    ```

2.  **Install Globally with Cargo (Recommended for Easy Access):**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the project directory
    cd budget_tracker_tui

    # Install the binary to Cargo's bin directory
    cargo install --path .
    ```

    After installation, the `Budget_Tracker` command should be available in your terminal directly.

    _Optional Tip:_ For even quicker access, you can set up a shell alias:

    ```bash
    # Example for bash/zsh (add to your .bashrc or .zshrc)
    alias bt='Budget_Tracker'
    ```

    Then, you can just type `bt` to launch the app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Storage

The application stores your transaction data in a `transactions.csv` file within a dedicated application data directory. The exact location depends on your operating system:

- **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/BudgetTracker/transactions.csv` (typically `~/.local/share/BudgetTracker/transactions.csv`)
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/BudgetTracker/transactions.csv`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\BudgetTracker\transactions.csv` (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\BudgetTracker\transactions.csv`)

The necessary directories are created automatically if they don't exist.
